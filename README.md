### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of South Florida. I work at the [Trustworthy Knowledge-Driven Artificial Intelligence (TKAI) Lab](https://tkai-lab.github.io/) focusing on neurosymbolic AI, predictive coding, and physics-informed neural networks. I am also a recipient of the 2024 [Quad Fellowship](https://www.quadfellowship.org/).

More broadly, I am interested in using machine learning as a tool to elucidate the mechanisms that drive biological and artificial intelligence. For this, I believe modern paradigms such as self-supervised learning, multi-modal learning, and continual learning could offer invaluable insight into the mechanisms of learning.

Apart from my research, I am a core maintainer for [Torchmetrics](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/torchmetrics) and a core contributor for [PyTorch Lightning Bolts](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning-bolts).

I was previously a research engineer at [Corpy](https://corpy.co.jp) where I worked as the team lead for an MLOps platform.

I previously worked at the [Computational Vascular Biomechanics Lab](https://bloodflow.engin.umich.edu/) as a PhD pre-candadiate in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Before that, I completed my MS in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities where I researched the computational phenotyping of thoracic aortic aneurysms in the [Barocas Lab](https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/barocas/home). I received my BS in Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
