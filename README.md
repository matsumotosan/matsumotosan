### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a second-year PhD student in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Briefly, my research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and computational neuroscience. My focus is two-fold:
1) Developing new methods for analyzing and interpreting neural datasets.
2) Drawing inspiration from biological brains to design novel architectures and methods

More broadly, I am interested in self-supervised learning, multi-modal learning, and numerical linear algebra.

Apart from my research, I am a core contributor for [PyTorch Lightning Bolts](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning-bolts).

I previously completed my MS in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities where I research the computational phenotyping of thoracic aortic aneurysms in the [Barocas Lab](https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/barocas/home).
