### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and computational neuroscience. My focus is two-fold:
1) Developing new methods for analyzing and interpreting neural datasets.
2) Drawing inspiration from biological brains to design novel architectures and methods

More broadly, I am interested in using machine learning as an introspective tool to elucidate the mechanisms that drive biological and artificial intelligence. Some tools of interest to me are self-supervised learning, multi-modal learning, and numerical linear algebra.

Apart from my research, I am a core contributor for [PyTorch Lightning Bolts](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning-bolts).

I previously worked at the [Computational Vascular Biomechanics Lab](https://bloodflow.engin.umich.edu/) during my PhD in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Before that, I completed my MS in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities where I researched the computational phenotyping of thoracic aortic aneurysms in the [Barocas Lab](https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/barocas/home).
