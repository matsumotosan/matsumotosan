### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a second-year PhD student in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Briefly, my research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and computational neuroscience. My focus is two-fold:
1) developing new methods for analyzing and interpreting neural datasets.
2) drawing inspiration from biological brains to design novel architectures and methods

Apart from my research, I am a core maintainer for PyTorch Lightning Bolts.
